# CodeAlpha HotelReservationSystem

A Java-based hotel reservation system developed during my internship at Code Alpha.

## Features
- Book rooms (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
- Cancel existing bookings
- View all bookings
- Automatically generate booking receipts

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
avac HotelReservationSystem.java

2. Run the program:


java HotelReservationSystem


## Notes
- Booking receipts are saved as text files with the booking ID as the filename.
- Room availability is checked before confirming a booking.
- If a room is unavailable, alternative available rooms are suggested.
